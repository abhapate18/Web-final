        <h2>The Origins of My Favorite Sport</h2>
        <section><p>
          The origins of tennis can be traced to games played in medieval Europe and Asia. These games involved hitting a ball with the hand or using simple implements. One of the earliest forms was the French game "jeu de paume," played in the 12th century, which involved hitting a ball with the hand in a courtyard.
        </p>
        <p>
          The precursor to modern lawn tennis was a game called "real tennis," played indoors on asymmetrical courts with elaborate rules. It gained popularity among European nobility during the 16th century. Real tennis courts can still be found in a few places today.
        </p>
        <p>
          The transition from real tennis to lawn tennis began in the late 19th century. Major Walter Clopton Wingfield is often credited with introducing the game of lawn tennis in 1873. He patented the equipment and rules for the game, and it quickly gained popularity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first tennis championship, now known as Wimbledon, was held at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in 1877. This marked a significant step in the formalization of the modern game. Wimbledon remains one of the most prestigious tennis tournaments in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the early 20th century, the distinction between amateur and professional players began to blur. This led to the Open Era in 1968, when all players were allowed to compete in major tournaments regardless of their amateur or professional status.
        </p>
        <p>Over the years, lawn tennis continued to evolve with changes in equipment, playing surfaces, and playing styles. The game witnessed the rise of legendary players like Rod Laver, Bjorn Borg, Pete Sampras, Serena Williams, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and many others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tennis was included in the Summer Olympics intermittently, but it was reintroduced as a full medal sport in 1988
        </p>
        <p>Today, lawn tennis is a global phenomenon with a massive fan following and numerous tournaments, including the Grand Slam events (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open). It has evolved from its humble beginnings to become a dynamic and highly competitive sport enjoyed by millions of players and spectators worldwide.</p>
